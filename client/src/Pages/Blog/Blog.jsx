        <h2>1. React 19.x & Major Additions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Partial Pre-rendering:</strong> React 19.2 introduces
            pre-render/resume capabilities allowing sections of an app to
            pre-render and resume later dynamically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Suspense Boundaries:</strong> SSR streaming is more
            consistent, improving reveal times and performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>React Foundation:</strong> A new React Foundation was formed
            to steward React and React Native under a more community-driven
            model.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Key Trends in React Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Server Components:</strong> Data fetching and rendering move
            closer to the server, reducing bundle sizes and improving startup
            speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptive Hydration:</strong> Rendering only interactive
            sections on the client improves efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance Tooling:</strong> New DevTools “Performance
            Tracks” provide deep insights into rendering behavior and
            scheduling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>State Management Simplified:</strong> Lightweight
            alternatives to Redux, like Context + Hooks or React Query, are
            increasingly popular.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Best Practices Moving Forward</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Adopt Partial Pre-rendering for hybrid SSR/SSG apps.</li>
          <li>
            Leverage the React Compiler to optimise rendering performance.
          </li>
          <li>Use Server Components and streaming for dynamic UI updates.</li>
          <li>Focus on bundle size and mobile-first optimisation.</li>
          <li>
            Keep up with the React Foundation roadmap for upcoming standards.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          React continues to evolve rapidly, blending server efficiency with
          client interactivity. With the 19.x releases, developers are empowered
          to build faster, leaner, and more scalable apps. As always, keep
          refining performance, simplifying state management, and focusing on
          the user experience across devices.
