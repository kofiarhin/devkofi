        "content": "## Why Markdown powers the DevKofi blog\n\nMarkdown keeps editorial workflows lightweight while letting engineers embed real code. The blog pipeline hydrates Markdown into React components so we can blend product updates and runnable snippets.\n\n### Tooling decisions\n\nWe layer `react-markdown` with `react-syntax-highlighter` for deterministic output inside Vite. The copy button leans on the Clipboard API with a safe fallback.\n\n```js\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n\nconst useCopyToClipboard = (value) => {\n  const copy = useCallback(async () => {\n    if (navigator?.clipboard?.writeText) {\n      await navigator.clipboard.writeText(value);\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    const textarea = document.createElement('textarea');\n    textarea.value = value;\n    textarea.setAttribute('readonly', '');\n    textarea.style.position = 'absolute';\n    textarea.style.left = '-9999px';\n    document.body.appendChild(textarea);\n    textarea.select();\n    const result = document.execCommand('copy');\n    document.body.removeChild(textarea);\n    return result;\n  }, [value]);\n\n  return copy;\n};\n\nexport default useCopyToClipboard;\n```\n\n### Rollout checklist\n\n1. Publish a JSON payload so every page reads the same source of truth.\n2. Render Markdown with deterministic styling in light and dark themes.\n3. Track link clicks with privacy-aware analytics hooks guarded by env flags.\n"
