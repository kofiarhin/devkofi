    question:
      "What’s the difference between buying a single course and joining Pro/VIP?",
    answer:
      "Single course is a one-time purchase you own forever. Pro (monthly) and VIP (yearly) are memberships that unlock access to all active courses while your subscription is active.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I keep access to courses after canceling my membership?",
    answer:
      "Access via membership ends at the end of your billing period. Any single courses you bought separately remain yours for life.",

    question: "How does the VIP discount code work?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch between Pro (monthly) and VIP (yearly)?",
